Also on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/499782)!

This mod lets you see how close you are to ranking up each social stat by:
- Displaying the exact number of points needed on the stats menu
- Making the stat circles expand as you gain points 
- Displaying how many extra points you've gained when at max rank (just for fun)

## Configuration
By selecting the mod in reloaded and pressing the **Configure Mod** button you can change each aspect of this mod. 

For example, you could disable the exact points display and just have the circles expand so you have to eyeball how close you are to ranking up.

## Cool Gif
It looks cool when the circles expand in real time
(You won't ever see this in normal gameplay obviously)
